```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# set globle options, use echo=true to let Rmd output all the codes along with the results.
# use str(knitr::opts_chunk$get()) command to see all settings
```

Load some libraries we will use.

```{r}
# Importing required libraries
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)
library(jtools)
library(rcompanion)
library(ggplot2)
library(car)
```

```{r}
rm(list = ls()) # Clear the workspace
```

### Starting by reading in the data and doing a simple summary of the variables.

```{r}

markdown <- read.csv('rocketfuel_deciles.csv')  # load the data file
summary(markdown)  # give a descriptive summary

```

Statistic Summary :
There are 6 variables as mentioned in the case study. Average for tor_impr (e total number of ad impressions the user encountered) is about 25 while the median is 13.

```{r}
#Output of summary statistics (min, max, mean, and s.d.) 
sumtb<- matrix(NA,nrow = 4, ncol = 7  )
# define an empty matrix to save the min, max, means and sd's
#number of rows = 4 and the number of columns = columns in Rocket Fuel Deciles
rownames(sumtb) <- c("min", "max", "mean", "sd")   # naming the rows
colnames(sumtb) <- colnames(markdown)  # naming the columns
sumtb[1,] <- round(apply(markdown,2,min),2)   #putting the min's of each variable into the first row
sumtb[2,] <- round(apply(markdown,2,max),2)  # putting the max's into the second row
sumtb[3,] <- round(apply(markdown,2,mean),2)  # putting the means into the third row
# Note: use round(command, X) to limit to X decimal places
# Note: use apply(df,margin, f) to apply function f to dataframe df on margin (1 for rows and 2 for columns) using function f (in this case mean)
sumtb[4,] <- round(apply(markdown,2,sd),2) # putting the s.d.'s into the fourth row
sumtb <- sumtb[,2:7] # rule out the first column since user_id is not meaningful to summarize. 
kable(sumtb)  # make the output matrix as a table
# This requires the library(knitr) called at the start

```
